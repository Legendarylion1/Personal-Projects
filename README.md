# Casino


## How to build
1. Be sure to have Python with PIP installed
2. Git clone the project to your local computer
3. Open the command prompt within the casino folder provided
4. install the pip requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Now we can test the installation by running Python on main.py
   
   This can be different depending on your version of Python and setup but here are some options to help. \*version\* refers to your version of Python. All of the following commands are run within the Casino folder on the command line.
   - `py main.py`
   - `Python main.py`
   - `Python*version* main.py`
   - Lastly, I use Visual Studio Code for Python so you can run `code .` and launch Python with the green arrow in Visual Studio

## How to play
1. When playing please make sure that your computer resolution is set to 1920x1080. Otherwise, functions will not work as expected
2. Playing the casino is very simple. When you launch the casino the first step is to create an account.
3. The username box is selected by default so you can begin typing your username
4. Be careful because once you hit enter you cannot change your username
5. Hit Enter and begin to type in your password
6. For first-time users you need to click new user here. And for returning players, you can press enter after entering your password.
   - First-time users should receive a message that says the account has been added
   - First-time users can go back and repeat steps 3-6 as a returning user.
7. Now that you are in the game you can click the big red button to test your odds in the casino
8. On the left is a set of buttons that allow you to change the amount you are betting
9. To close the application you should use the command line. Either close the command prompt or stop the program with `CTRL+C`
10. The final step is to HAVE FUN. Try and make as much money as you can.
