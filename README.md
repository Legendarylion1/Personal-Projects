# Pokemon Game
   This pong game was my first attempt at rendering in C++. Making games is the way that I get to learn new techniques and show off my progress. I've made a lot of projects in Python so I figured that I would try my hand at making a game in C++. It took a while to learn how to render graphics to a graphics card. I took C++ classes at Princeton back during my freshman and sophomore years in high school, but I was rusty. This project allowed me to relearn C++ and get an idea of the advantages that the languages offered over Python. I believe that knowing the different advantages of each programming language is very important for a software engineer. I didn't dive into pointers and memory for this project, but my Dungeon Crawler game shows my first use of memory in a project. Pong is a very simple application, and for all of the games that I code, I try to do them from scratch without a tutorial. Graphics programming however required a tutorial and it was very helpful to learn how the different pipelines functioned. With many trips back and forth between documentation and visual studio I was able to create my first graphical application in C++. Enjoy.
