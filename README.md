# Personal-Projects
My attempt at making my personal projects public

Currently, there are 4 projects in this repository. Some of my other projects and accomplishments in other programming languages are technically school work, so I am not sure if
I am able to share those publically. Also for my music program. Yes, there was actual music and not just me yelling into my mic for sound, but I don't think I am allowed to share
those music files publically either so you would have to add your own. Lastly, I want to say that I am proud of everything that I have worked on and I hope you can appreciate my
journey as a programmer alongside me. :)

Casino
-------
For all of my projects I used py-to-exe to make an executable for my friends to use, but I have not included that in this repository for any of them. To use the casino you must
first type in your username press enter, type in your password and press new user. Then you repeat the process of typing in your username and password but this time you press
enter. Along the left side of the screen you can select your betting amount, and in the bottom right you can spin the casino. When you are all done playing you can simply press
escape and the game should close
