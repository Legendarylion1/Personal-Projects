# Personal-Projects
Hi, I just wanted to say that I am getting a lot of traffic into my GitHub which is great, and I want to impress you all as much as possible. That being said I do not have my most recent projects in my public github yet. Please come back later in the week and you can see my most recent projects. I think they really highlight the skills that I have learned over the years and showcase my improvement as a software engineer. After I am done working on the GitHub Branch for my Pokemon game, I will be uploading a game that I made with a custom particle system with a physics engine. That is a really cool project that I didn't fully finish, but the coding challenges I tackled in it show a lot of my knowledge of data structures and algorithms. I also created a chess game with multiple working servers that I plan on uploading here. The particle system game was created in C++ and the Chess was created in Python. For all of my projects feel free to email me and tell me what you think. I appreciate all feedback and it will help me grow as a person and as a programmer. One last thing to note is that I do not upload all of my projects to this public repo. I have a private repo in which I do most of my work. Programming is my passion and I am happy to share it with you.

Thanks for coming to check out my personal projects. In this repository are my 4 favorite projects I have worked on so far. Each project had a different goal or challenge that I was trying to overcome. For Pong, I wanted to test my knowledge of C++ and of using OpenGL for the first time. For the Casino, I wanted to spend real time working on a project to see if I could complete something of considerable size in my favorite language. Lastly, for “Torin’s Hardest Game” I wanted to try my best to complete an original game idea working about 3 hours a day in the 4 days leading up to Christmas. Lastly, I want to say that I am proud of everything that I have worked on and I hope you can appreciate my journey as a programmer alongside me.

## Pokemon Game
#### Work in progress...
[Pokemon Game Branch](../Pokemon-Game)

This Pokemon game is a really fun project. Recently my friends and I got back into Pokemon Go, and I was inspired to create my own Pokemon game. I am uploading the code as I have it right now, and I do know that there are some spots that I wish to change. I plan on refactoring, making this code spotless and the most beautiful project that I have ever worked on. Currently, there are only three main things to work on. One is the art for the Pokemon and the map. Two is the animations for the attacks of the Pokemon, and three is the cutscenes for the player as they progress through the story. If you look through the code, I have written and tested the cutscenes and they work perfectly, as well as the Pokemon art and attacks. I just have to do the art and directing for the story. I am not a game designer so these things take time, but I will complete this project as I am very determined to do so. This is turning out to be my favorite project so far because I feel that I have really nailed the feel of the old-school Pokemon games. The movement feels really good, and the Pokemon art feels straight out of the game. Please feel free to check out the code. Some things may not work as you may expect them to, but it is only due to the fact that you are using my save file for the game called "data.pc". I have written a small encryption algorithm and I plan on serializing the data and adding a checksum to make it even more secure. My friends really love to try and hack my games by messing with the data files. Again thank you for checking out my Pokemon code.

## Dungeon Crawler
#### Completed May 25, 2023

This dungeon crawler was a challenging one. I would say that this is the most challenging coding project that I have ever done. The goal was to create an infinite scrolling fighting game that I could play online with my friends. A lot of the code in the project looks weird, but it was designed with multiplayer in mind. I learned a lot of lessons from the project that will be more explained in the branch's readme. This code was so much fun to design because of the numerous challenges that I had to overcome. Solving problems and having to come up with creative solutions is my favorite part of programming. My favorite parts of this project were figuring out how to design the levels, and figuring out the math behind the items and particles. I try not to look up things when I am coding these personal projects. So my math is kind of wrong, but trying to figure out a solution is the fun part for me. I really enjoy problem solving and I get to share my creative solutions with you. I was doing an internship at Lockheed Martin at the time that I was coding this, so I wasn't able to finish development, but this code gave me the building blocks for my Pokemon Project. I really wanted to explore pointers and complex mathematics in this project which I think I did successfully. I left the game in a playable state where you can run around an infinite dungeon and fight enemies, but multiplayer and menu screens were never created. I had SO much fun with this project and I hope you enjoy exploring the complexities of this one.

## Chess Game
#### Completed April 8, 2023

I feel like chess is a right of passage when it comes to being a software engineer. When I look at other people coding on YouTube everyone has made a chess game. So I figured that I would need to make one in Python. I wasn't into chess at the time so I didn't really know how it worked, but I wanted to create a chess game that I could play online with my friends. I coded this project on and off for about a month. I probably put a max of 10 hours into this project. I really liked this project because I was able to host multiple chess games at once on my server. People were able to play in the game and spectators could even join to watch. When I was done coding this project I had invited my friends over and we all hopped onto the server to play chess games. We had a really good time and the development of this project was very smooth. After coding this I was inspired to actually learn chess and I reached 1300 playing 5 minute blitz on chess.com. The idea of creating games with servers was so much fun to me that I decided to learn networking. I have since learned a lot about the different PDUs involved in networking through school and personal research. I hope in the future to make an online fighting game using what I have learned from this chess game. Thanks for checking out my chess project.

## Pong Game
#### Completed Dec 29, 2022
[Pong Game Branch](../Pong-Game)

Fun project creating pong with openGL32 and glfw. The thing that I can say I learned the most while creating this was abstraction. As I created more things in the project I found myself needing to use similar functionality more often meaning that I should try to refactor my old code to work with the new code that I was trying to write. This led to the creation of the objectRenderer class. I also left up the square renderer class as a look of what I started with but there was a lot of refactoring with this project once I realized what I was doing.

Something I would do better. For the numbers, I had the idea to create a function that just takes in the score, figures out the number of digits in the score, for spacing purposes, and displays the correct score to the screen with only the need for numbers 0-9. There is no need to implement this for this project though but it will be in the next one.

One last thing I would've done differently is to have the game render the objects rather than the objects each having their own renderer. I don't think it is the object's responsibility to render themselves, but the game should do that. 

Thanks for checking it out!

## Torin's Hardest Game
#### Completed Dec 25, 2021
[Torin's Hardest Game Branch](../Torins-Hardest-Game)

This is a project that I wanted to try and make over my holiday break. I wanted to make a game for my friends and I to speedrun, and it worked out pretty well for the time spent on it. The file system from my casino game was being abused by my friends so I changed how that worked as well as the login in general. The attempt counter may be off. I ran out of time to debug that problem. The main point of the game is to try and complete it as fast as possible. Also, another part of the game is that I am not supposed to explain to you how to play. So have fun, and don't cheat!

Sorry, but I'm not going to show you the game here. You should play it for yourself, and figure out how it works. Part of the rules of the game is that I can't explain the rules of the game. Have fun :)

## Casino
#### Completed Sept 13, 2021
[Casino Branch](../Casino)

This casino project was inspired by a trip I took with my grandma to the casinos. I don’t know much about gambling but every time I saw the spin on the digital computer screen I thought to myself. I think I can do that. I would brainstorm the entire trip home, and then I got to work. I had a fun time completing that project. Writing this description a year later I can look back on the project and say that I wish I had used classes a lot more. It would've saved me so much time and headache. In “casinoBack.py” the spin function is 600 lines longer than it needs to be if I had just used a class, but that comes with learning. Again, thanks for supporting my journey as a programmer.
