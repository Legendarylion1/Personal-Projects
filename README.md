# Personal-Projects
Hi, I just wanted to say that I am getting a lot of traffic into my GitHub which is great, and I want to impress you all as much as possible. That being said I do not have my most recent projects in my public github yet. Please come back later so you can see my most recent projects. All of my projects highlight the skills that I have learned over the years and showcase my improvement as a software engineer. I appreciate all feedback and it will help me grow as a person and as a programmer.

Thanks for coming to check out my personal projects. In this repository, I have my favorite projects that I have worked on so far. My absolute must-see top 3 projects are my [Pokemon Game](#pokemon-game), [Dungeon Crawler](#dungeon-crawler), and my [Casino](#casino). These were my favorite projects to work on. I have learned so much over the years and each program in this repository grows in size and complexity. This repository showcases my growing knowledge of object-oriented concepts from coding the casino to my most recent Pokemon project. These three projects boast my hardest coding problems and you get to read about and see my solutions to all of them. A lot of my programming is inspired by the outside world, whether it be challenges that I face and I want to program a solution for them, or my friends and I playing a game that I want to try and recreate. I hope you can feel the love and passion as you read and appreciate my journey as a software engineer alongside me.

## Pokemon Game
#### Work in progress...
[Pokemon Game Branch](../Pokemon-Game)

This Pokemon game is a really fun project. Recently my friends and I got back into Pokemon Go, and I was inspired to create my own Pokemon game. I am uploading the code as I have it right now, and I do know that there are some spots that I wish to change. I plan on refactoring, making this code spotless and the most beautiful project that I have ever worked on. Currently, there are only three main things to work on. One is the art for the Pokemon and the map. Two is the animations for the attacks of the Pokemon, and three is the cutscenes for the player as they progress through the story. If you look through the code, I have written and tested the cutscenes and they work perfectly, as well as the Pokemon art and attacks. I just have to do the art and directing for the story. I am not a game designer so these things take time, but I will complete this project as I am very determined to do so. This is turning out to be my favorite project so far because I feel that I have really nailed the feel of the old-school Pokemon games. The movement feels really good, and the Pokemon art feels straight out of the game. Please feel free to check out the code. Some things may not work as you may expect them to, but it is only because you are using my development save file for the game called "data.pc". I have written a small encryption algorithm and I plan on serializing the data and adding a checksum to make it even more secure because my friends love to try and hack my games by messing with the data files. Again thank you for checking out my Pokemon code.

## Dungeon Crawler
#### Completed May 25, 2023

This dungeon crawler was a challenging one. I would say that this is the most challenging coding project that I have ever done. The goal was to create an infinite scrolling fighting game that I could play online with my friends. A lot of the code in the project looks weird, but it was designed with multiplayer in mind. I learned a lot of lessons from the project that will be more explained in the branch's readme. This code was so much fun to design because of the numerous challenges that I had to overcome. Solving problems and having to come up with creative solutions is my favorite part of programming. My favorite parts of this project were figuring out how to design the levels, and figuring out the math behind the items and particles. I try not to look up things when I am coding these personal projects so my math is kind of wrong which I go into more detail about, but trying to figure out a solution is the fun part for me. I really enjoy problem solving and I get to share my creative solutions with you. I was doing an internship at Lockheed Martin at the time that I was coding this, so I wasn't able to finish development, but this code gave me the building blocks for my Pokemon Project. I wanted to explore pointers and complex mathematics in this project which I think I did successfully. I left the game in a playable state where you can run around an infinite dungeon and fight enemies, but multiplayer and menu screens were never created. I had SO much fun with this project and I hope you enjoy exploring the complexities of this one.

## Chess Game
#### Completed April 8, 2023

I feel like chess is a right of passage when it comes to being a software engineer. When I look at other people coding on YouTube everyone has made a chess game. So I figured that I would need to make one in Python. I wasn't into chess at the time so I didn't really know how it worked, but I wanted to create a chess game that I could play online with my friends. I coded this project on and off for about a month. I probably put a max of 10 hours into this project. My favorite part about this project is that I was able to host multiple chess games at once on my server. People were able to play in the game and spectators could even join to watch. When I was done coding this project I invited my friends over and we all hopped onto the server to play chess games. We had a good time and the development of this project was also very smooth. After coding this I was inspired to learn chess and I reached 1300 playing 5-minute blitz on chess.com. The idea of creating games with servers was so much fun to me that I decided to learn networking. I have since learned a lot about the different PDUs and protocols involved in networking through school and personal research. I hope in the future to make an online fighting game using what I have learned from this chess game. Thanks for checking out my chess project.

## Pong Game
#### Completed Dec 29, 2022
[Pong Game Branch](../Pong-Game)

This is just a fun project creating pong using openGL32, glfw, and C++. The thing that I can say I learned the most while creating this was abstraction. As I created more things in the project I found myself needing to use similar functionality more often meaning that I should try to refactor my old code to work with the new code that I was trying to write. This led to the creation of the objectRenderer class. I also left up the square renderer class as a look of what I started with but there was a lot of refactoring with this project once I realized what I was doing. Before this project, I coded almost exclusively in Python. I took C++ classes at Princeton when I was younger, but I was trying to create more than a console rock paper scissors. Relearning C++ was a lot of fun and I got to learn more about the resources I have available as well. I didn't realize until this project how much of a skill it is to be able to correctly access a problem and to search for help online. Using these resources I got to learn a lot about C++ which I planned on using in my future projects. I hope you enjoy a look at my first steps back into C++.

## Torin's Hardest Game
#### Completed Dec 25, 2021
[Torin's Hardest Game Branch](../Torins-Hardest-Game)

For this project, I wanted to try my best to complete an original game idea working about 3 hours a day in the 4 days leading up to Christmas. I wanted to make a game for my friends and I to speedrun, and it worked out pretty well for the time spent on it.  The file system from my casino game was being abused by my friends so I changed how that worked as well as the login in general. The attempt counter doesn't work as intended, but I ran out of time to debug that problem. The main point of the game is to try and complete it as fast as possible. Also, another part of the game is that I am not supposed to explain to you how to play. So have fun, and don't cheat! The fastest time to complete every single level was set by my friend Tobiah, who did it in 6 seconds. He did cheat, but I'm not going to let my faulty code take away from his win.

Sorry, but I'm not going to show you the game here. You should play it for yourself, and figure out how it works. Part of the rules of the game is that I can't explain the rules of the game. Have fun :)

## Casino
#### Completed Sept 13, 2021
[Casino Branch](../Casino)

This casino project was inspired by a trip I took with my grandma to the casinos. I don’t know much about gambling but every time I saw the spin on the digital computer screen I thought to myself. I think I can do that. I would brainstorm the entire trip home, and then I got to work. I had a fun time completing that project. Writing this description a year later I can look back on the project and say that I wish I had used classes a lot more. It would've saved me so much time and headache. In “casinoBack.py” the spin function is 600 lines longer than it needs to be if I had just used a class, but that comes with learning. Again, thanks for supporting my journey as a programmer.
