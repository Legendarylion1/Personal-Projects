## How to build
1. Be sure to have Python with PIP installed
2. Git clone the project to your local computer
3. Open the command prompt within the casino folder provided
4. install the pip requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

   This can be different depending on your version of Python and setup but here are some options to help. \*version\* refers to your version of Python. All of the following commands are run within the Casino folder on the command line.
   - `py main.py`
   - `Python main.py`
   - `Python*version* main.py`
   - Lastly, I use Visual Studio Code for Python so you can run `code .` and launch Python with the green arrow in Visual Studio
