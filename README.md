## How to build
1. git clone the repository to your local computer
2. I do not yet have makefiles for this project, so you will need to run the Visual Studio community solution
   - The file is "`Dungeon Crawler.sln`"
3. When you open the solution set the build platform to win32 or x86 at the top middle
   - I believe that it defaults to x64
   - If you are having trouble finding it. It is under that menu tab at the top that says "`Test`"
   - It is also to the left of the green arrow for the "`local windows debugger`"
4. Now you can navigate to the build tab at the top middle and select "`build solution`"
5. This creates an executable for you to run and play the game
6. You can find the executable in the Debug folder created.
   - The executable should be named "`Dungeon Crawler.exe`"
