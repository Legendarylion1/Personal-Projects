	05:44 p.m. - I have spent about an hour and a half writing my encryption and decryption algorithms and they work now
	09:36 p.m. - About 2 hours in I have succesfully found a way to extract accounts and store them
	11:26 p.m. - I have worked on the front end of the default login. The bubbles are there with no text

12/22/2021
	9:26  p.m. - I have spent about 3 and a half hours working on the different screens and I have them done besides the * runoff on the right. Well get to that...
	10:38 p.m. - 10 minutes and two lines of code has yielded us a runoff shield

	01:33 a.m. - The screens all work and function as intended. I can add an account sign into an account and it looks great. The only thing I need to do is add error messages
	01:48 a.m. - Spent since the last time working out a bug in the decryption. It was with t and n being in the wrong places on the decryption. I still need to add click checks for other accounts than just number one. Just want to say that I am very proud of what I have done here. This looks amazing in my opinion
	02:08 a.m. - Cleaned up code and wrote comments before bed. I also did a code line count. We are at 1,688 lines of code. Not including all of our deleted tests code. Pretty insane. I wonder if in the future I can get the number down
	12:18 p.m. - The login screens all work now. All click features have been implemented and there are seemingly no bugs in the code. Things are working too well, but I can now work on the actual game
	05:13 p.m. - Everything login related workds. I worked on the main file and spent time figuring out what I needed to return for each function. Its been about two and a half hours now
	10:13 p.m. - Idk how long I spent, but I "completed the first level". It just needs to return the correct things. I may need to overhaul the file system. To make things more efficient.

	06:03 p.m. - I am feeling sick today, but Im sure I worked atleast half an hour on changing the file system, and made a new module for it. The overhaul is complete. Time to work on the actual levels?
	10:20 p.m. - Feeling better, but the best times now work. The overhaul needed some work to coincide well with the changes I made to formatting times. Encryption also needed minor if statements and it took about an hour or two so not bad
	10:23 p.m. - Just want to do another code count I am at 1,955 lines of code

	2:59 a.m. - MERRY MOTHERFUCKING CHRISTMAS. Its a good day. Popped off on Jayce with mali on graves, and I set the groundwork for lvl 2. All levels should work seamlessly now, with the formula set up. This game should progress smoothly from here on out! :)
	6:25 p.m. - I did not get to work much, but levels 1-4 are done. The base game "mechanics" have been explained. The game is now "playable" and in v0.9 which is still beta
