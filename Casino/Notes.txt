Worked on the casino project. 
I have nearly finished the login screen. 
I want to tweak a few design flaws and implement the actual file login portion.

Officially finished the login screen getting to work on the actual casino today probably
Everything goes back to main and the login fully works with no real bugs besides of course
the size of text that people input to the systems
	TODO: I need to take notice of where the username was input so that I can pop it 3 times to erase it 
	and put in the new values for the user
	Otherwise we are giving them a "new account" everytime they play to update their winnings

I finished the TODO from above

9/13/21
I seem to have neglected this notes page, but I have finished the casino project
5 days it seems I have worked on it, but it is fully complete with all of the functions
of a casino. The only thing left to do that I am not going to be doing is allowing for people to
have more control over their user names and passwords, but I dont care to do that
The project was about the main aspect and feel that I got from going to the casino with grandma
and I made it a reality. It was a lot of fun and I am proud to say that the job is finished
RIP KOBE

P.S. Idk if kobe would be happy with me ending it without changing the login lmfao
